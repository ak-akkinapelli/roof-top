A simple react based app to draw on rooftop image loaded into a canvas.
There are buttons to clear the existing drawing and to export the current state of the image with drawing on it. 
When any closed polygon is found a message is shown on UI but there is no restriction that only polygons are allowed to be drawn. 
I used basic react hooks, canvas, mouse tracking events to cover most of the app with basic styling.
